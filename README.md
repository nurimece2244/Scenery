# Scenery
The text file received was read and the words were to be separated with the semicolon. It is kept in the array depending on whether it is a building or a tree. If it is a building, assign it to the number of floors, x center, width, and color. If it's a tree, assign the x center. Since other values are already fixed, so use directly in building and tree classes. Also drew the drawbuilding methods in the classes according to the StdDraw library.
